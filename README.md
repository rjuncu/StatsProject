# StatsProject-Titanic Data 
This is a group project completed by Maria Kim, Isaac Samuel Racine, Soniya Lama, Rucsanda Juncu, and Nikolay Makarenko. It was completed for the Masters in Bioinformatics at KU Leuven.

A full statistical analysis was conducted on data describing victims of the Titanic. Missing data was accounted for with four different methods, which were then compared using AIC. The four methods that were tested are: case deletion, complete case, mean imputation, and predictive mean matching.
